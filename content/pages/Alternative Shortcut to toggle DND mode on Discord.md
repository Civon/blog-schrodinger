## TL;DR

toggle steamer mode to ignore all pop-up and sound notifications.



## Why 
#DND (Do Not Disturb) mode is a healthy way to for me to keep focus and avoid distraction.
But. Its hard to Duckduckgo keywords like "DND on Discord", so I am here to share my workaround.

## How
My approach is using **Streamer Mode** as DND alternative. 
By adding custom shortcut in Discord **KeyBinds** settings, for example: `SHIFT + CTRL + ALT + D`, you are able to easily toggle DND-like function for daily usage.

Also, It is a global shortcut, so you are able to toggle it anywhere on the desktop
